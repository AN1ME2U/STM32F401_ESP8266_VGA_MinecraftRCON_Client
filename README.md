# STM32F401_ESP8266_VGA_MinecraftRCON_Client
MineraftRCON client, based on STM32F401 and ESP8266. STM32 as usb keyboard host and VGA sygnal generator. ESP8266 used fot Wi-Fi connectivity with server.

First revision of the board can be found here: https://oshwlab.com/CONODIDA/stm32-esp8266-rcon-vga-terminal

It containts STM32F401 microcontroller and ESP-07 module with all pins connected to external male/female pinheaders. 
Also there is a male/female pinheaders for 5v, 3.3v and GND lines.
Power supply cleated on LM2596s, which is setted for 5v output.
3.3v generated by LDL1117S50R.
There is a 2 3.3v power supply lines. One for the STM32 and ESP-07, another one used for perepheral madules supply.

Pixel clock generated by extepnal smd generator(25MHz). HSE oscillator frequensy is 8MHz.
RGB pins of DSUB-15(VGA) connected together with MOSI of SPI1.
Pixel stream activates in time by timer and generates with DMA using HAL. Algorytm can be found in generator_v3b.c.
Some settings made in settings.h.
